The app is fully functional and works, but needs some added functionality if I actually want people to use it:

-Better UI design (make it pretty)
-Better user experience
  -Having a way to clear TextViews when you click on them
  -AM/PM button
-Accounting for human error
  -people (like me) are good at make mistakes when they input information. There is currently no way to go back to a previous course if somebody inputs the wrong info.
  -logic errors
      -Start Time must be smaller than End Time
      -Classes can not be at the same time
      -Classes (probably) can not have the same name
-Future functionality
  -Setting a "main schedule" to distinguish between your own schedule and schedule of friends
  -Capability to compare (ideally friends') schedules to current time to determine availability
  -Using SQL database hosted by Azure instead of internal storage
  -Making schedules deletable lol
  -Put it on the PlayStore
